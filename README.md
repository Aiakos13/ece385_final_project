# Implementation of Feeding Frenzy in System Verilog
# Introduction
> ** Our project designs and creates an implementation of the game Feeding Frenzy, a game in which a fish consumes other fish smaller than itself to grow larger to eat fish of a larger size. We decided that this project would be an effective use of our skills and enjoyable to make. This project will expand our knowledge and skills of the FPGA. The result was an enjoyable game with several characters and many functionalities applied from our knowledge obtained in ECE385 through our lectures and projects throughout the semester.**
